# Data-Archive

The problem being analised within the documented assignment was to learn to work with new tools for data analytics. Through the use of new tools we looked at the data of Video game sales and looked at the differences between the sales of the games and the scores awarded to the games by critics. We were able to learn how to use the tools to look at the difference between the data through transforming, aggregating and visualising the data. We can see that the critic score for a game does not neccesarily have an effect on the sales of the game for different genres.

The directory structure for the of the project is as follows. How to access the Raw data to complete the Transformations of the data. Transformations done on the data and the outputs. Aggregations done on the data and outputs. Visulisation of the data. Outline of the project.
